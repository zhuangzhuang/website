		<title>VSWhere and Visual Studio 2017 Support</title>
		<updated>2017-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Since version 0.18.0 of Cake, there has been support created for Visual Studio 2017. The support was added to the MSBuild tool to search for the default installation locations of the various flavors of MSBuild. The default locations did not require an external dependency on the &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Interop/"&gt;Microsoft.VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Interop&lt;/a&gt; package that was created by Microsoft to help locate Visual Studio 2017 installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the release of version 0.18.0, Microsoft released a tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vswhere"&gt;vswhere&lt;/a&gt; to help locate Visual Studio and other products in the family. This tool was released with Cake version 0.19.1 to allow everyone that moved to Visual Studio 2017 to get their builds up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to walk through the different pieces of functionality supported by the &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/dsl/vswhere/"&gt;VSWhere tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>Cake v0.19.1 released</title>
		<updated>2017-03-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.19.1 of Cake has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a minor hotfix release for 0.19.0, which fixes an issue discovered in the new VSWhere aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is VSWhere? One issue with Visual Studio 2017 is that it can be installed anywhere, and you can have multiple versions side by side. As a result the registry keys, and standard paths previously used to identify where Visual Studio was installed, no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where VSWhere comes in.  It's a utility that can identify and list current installations of Visual Studio, as well as other developer products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VSWhere is available on &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/vswhere/"&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/vswhere"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;) which means you can fetch it using the tool pre-processor directive like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/dsl/vswhere/"&gt;VSWhere aliases&lt;/a&gt; available in Cake.  If you just want to use the latest Visual Studio version available - then there's the &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Common.Tools.VSWhere/VSWhereAliases/59EB3043"&gt;VSWhereLatest&lt;/a&gt; alias. A complete example of fetching the VSWhere tool and using it to find path to MSBuild is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cake v0.19.0 released</title>
		<updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.19.0 of Cake has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release of Cake is a smaller release in preparation for upgrading Cake itself to utilize latest RTM .NET SDK and Visual Studio 2017. The goal for v0.20.0 is also to unify around one scripting engine - Roslyn version 2.0 and depreciating the Mono scripting engine, this will likely result in raising the minimum supported version of .NET and Mono. We will before next release document and communicate exact versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly recommend you pin the current version of Cake your using to avoid any unplanned interruption in your builds as the result of any potential future breaking changes. The &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/pinning-cake-version"&gt;Pinning Cake Version&lt;/a&gt; under the tutorials section of our website describes how to achieve this with the default bootstrappers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the Cake Team have been overwhelmed by the number of contributions from our Community Members.  Simply put... THANK YOU!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cake v0.18.0 released</title>
		<updated>2017-03-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.18.0 of Cake has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release of Cake sees a number of new features added, as well as some bug fixes, however, most importantly, there's a couple of breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minor breaking changes involve the old obsoleted DNU alias have been removed and WiXHeat had an incorrect signature which have been corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger breaking change is that with this release addins must target at least Cake.Core version 0.16.2 or later, addins targeting older versions will abort script execution.
Many addins have already been updated and the many of those who have not yet upgraded, have pull requests ready for them. If any of the addins you use should be affected by this, please raise an issue in that addins repository. We've tried to reach out to all authors, but with hundreds of addins we've surely missed one or two.
We do recommend you pin your builds to the version of Cake you using, that way you reduce the risk of builds failing because breaking changes. Instead you can do a controlled upgrade and take your time to sort any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the more notable new features is MSBuild / Visual Studio 2017 support and support for loading scripts from NuGet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also pleased to announce that from this release and forward all official Cake binaries will be signed with a .NET Foundation certificate, this isn't strong naming, so it won't affect addins in any way, just ensure the authenticity of the binaries.
&lt;img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1647294/23683657/8172ad14-039a-11e7-9d95-a4701bfd7f61.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth noting in a near future release we will update to and unify around latest stable version Roslyn scripting - this means Mono scripting engine will be removed, we will still run on Mono, but we will require a newer version of Mono than we do today. This will bring a lot of benefit for Cake as we will be able to support the latest C# features and reduce the maintenance burden and error process of maintaining multiple scripting engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Cake.Paket - An Addin and Module to Add Support for Paket in Cake</title>
		<updated>2017-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Most .NET developers are comfortable using &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/"&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; to manage their dependencies. This is probably why Cake has such great support for it. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/"&gt;Paket&lt;/a&gt; which is a popular alternative has very little support. Luckily, with the help of &lt;a href="https://github.com/larzw/Cake.Paket"&gt;Cake.Paket&lt;/a&gt; you can make Paket a first class citizen in your Cake scripts!&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Dave Glick and I run the &lt;a href="http://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam static site engine&lt;/a&gt; project. I'm also a big Cake fanboy, and over the last couple months I've been privileged to work with the rest of the Cake team on transitioning the Cake website from a dynamic ASP.NET website to a static one built by &lt;a href="http://wyam.io"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt;. This effort was more than mere window dressing; the new site goes beyond the old one in some interesting ways:&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;We released the Cake for Visual Studio extension back in September and have been thrilled with the response from the whole community. There's been plenty of activity over &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vs"&gt;on the GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; with new issues, bug reports, features and even PRs. Now, you can get the benefits of all the brand new features as they arrive, right in Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<updated>2016-11-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.17.0 of Cake has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release of Cake sees a number of new features added, as well as some bug fixes, however, most importantly, there was a breaking change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This breaking change centred around the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="/api/Cake.Common.Tools.VSTest/VSTestSettings"&gt;VSTestSettings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; class, where the decision was wait to allow custom loggers to be passed into the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="/api/Cake.Common.Tools.VSTest/VSTestRunner"&gt;VSTestRunner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  As a result, the previous enumeration named &lt;code&gt;VSTestLogger&lt;/code&gt; has been removed, and replaced with a fully customizable string.  If you are using this enumeration in your scripts then you will see errors being generated if you update to the latest version of Cake.  You should be able to make use of the new extension methods called &lt;code&gt;WithVisualStudioLogger&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WithAppVeyorLogger&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="/api/Cake.Common.Tools.VSTest/VSTestSettings"&gt;VSTestSettings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to replace the enumeration values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;There are many scenarios where you need to send notifications during your build process, such as notifying colleagues that a build has passed/failed, notifying stakeholders that a package has been published to nuget, etc. One of the most popular ways to send such notification is, of course, email. That's why we recently released three new addins to send emails.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>Cake v0.16.2 released</title>
		<updated>2016-10-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.16.2 of Cake has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the release of Cake v0.16.1, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Redth"&gt;Redth&lt;/a&gt; identified an issue with Cake not being identified as a .NET assembly when launched from a Mono process. With the help of &lt;a href="https://github.com/akoeplinger"&gt;akoeplinger&lt;/a&gt; we identified the issue in the Mono runtime and the PE32+ format assemblies generated by Roslyn/csc.exe when targeting x64 (&lt;em&gt;which is the default in .NET Core project.json toolchain&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href="https://github.com/akoeplinger"&gt;akoeplinger&lt;/a&gt; has already submitted a &lt;a href="https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/3745"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to Mono for this, so we expect this to be fixed in future versions of Mono, meanwhile the workaround is to set platform to use &lt;em&gt;AnyCPU&lt;/em&gt; explicitly in the &lt;em&gt;project.json&lt;/em&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, v0.16.2 of Cake is now available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.&lt;/p&gt;

But since the v0.16.1 release of Cake, thanks to &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/1015"&gt;porting Cake to .NET Core&lt;/a&gt;, it is now also possible to debug Cake files using Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<updated>2016-09-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Version 0.16.0 of Cake has been released, and it's a big release!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only are we supporting the full .NET framework (&lt;em&gt;v4.5&lt;/em&gt;), but from this version
we will also support running Cake on platforms capable of running .NET Core (&lt;em&gt;netstandard1.6&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, you will have to install the &lt;code&gt;Cake.CoreCLR&lt;/code&gt; package instead
of the normal &lt;code&gt;Cake&lt;/code&gt; package. A blog post describing this more in detail
will be published soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let us know if you run into any issues with this latest release.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2016-08-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, we recently opened an issue on GitHub to discuss the problem of &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/1136"&gt;Cake addins becoming stale&lt;/a&gt;.  This blog post aims to recap the discussion that was had within that issue, as well as the plan going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I want to re-iterate is that the Cake Team are not attempting to throttle or take over the development of Cake addins/modules in anyway.  We love the fact that there is a thriving Community behind Cake, and we want to encourage that.  However, we do have a responsibility to the wider Cake Community and we want to ensure that any addins and modules that are created, can continue to be maintained, should the original developer no longer be in a position to maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.myget.org"&gt;MyGet&lt;/a&gt; is a hosted package server that allows hosting of the following package types:&lt;/p&gt;
